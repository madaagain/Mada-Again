# Hey, I'm Mada-Again 👩‍🎤
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm just a random guy who loves programming. My journey through code is essentially guided by curiosity: if something seems interesting, I'll dive into it 🧌.

## About Me
As a developer, I enjoy coding with C, C++, and Python. These languages are my go-to tools because they're just fun to work with. An average day when I program is from low-level to system programming to my current focus on implementing **safer AI** on local machines in the simplest way possible for users 🦹.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox
Main Languages: C, C++, Python. sometimes X86-64 assembly (very rarely) 🍟
Tools & Technologies: Git, Linux, Docker, Ansible...
Interests: Systems programming, Application development, Automation, and exploring new technologies 🏗️.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning @EPITECH - European Institute Of Technology

- I enjoy Advanced concepts in C++20 and the latest in Python 3.9+
- Exploring ML/DL algorithms and the application of NLP/LLM on more modest, power-efficient machines
- Diving deeper into low-level programming and Software Arhitecture

## ✨ My Goals

- To share more of my projects with the community and contribute to open-source projects.

- To continuously expand my knowledge and skills in both familiar and new domains.

- To build and contribute to meaningful projects.
